# Shopping List (CLI Version 2 - File Persistence)

This project is an improved version of the Shopping List application.

## Description

In this version, the shopping list is saved to the local disk using a JSON file.

Unlike the first version (where the list was stored in memory only), the data now persists between program executions.  
This means your shopping list is still available the next time you run the script.

This project helps practice:

- Reading and writing files in Python
- Working with JSON format
- Data persistence
- Managing program state
- User interaction and loops

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- No external dependencies

## How to Run

```bash
python3 shopping_list_v2.py
