# Terminal RPG Battle (CLI)

This project is a command-line role-playing game where you fight against an enemy in a turn-based battle.

## Description

In this terminal RPG, you can:

- Attack the enemy
- Drink a potion to heal
- Get attacked in return

The game continues until either you or the enemy loses all health.

This project is designed to practice combining multiple Python basics into a complete program, including:

- Variables and math operations
- User input with `input()`
- Loops
- Conditional logic (if / elif / else)
- Using modules (especially `random`)
- Displaying information with f-strings

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- No external dependencies

## How to Run

```bash
python3 terminal_rpg.py
