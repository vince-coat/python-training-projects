# Mystery Number Game (CLI)

This project is a fun command-line game where you have to guess a mystery number.

## Description

The computer randomly chooses a number between **0 and 100**, and your goal is to find it 😎

You have a **limited number of attempts**. After each guess, the program tells you if the mystery number is **higher** or **lower** than your input.

This project helps practice:

- Loops
- `input()` and user interaction
- Basic game logic
- Using Python modules (random)

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- No external dependencies

## How to Run

```bash
python3 mystery_number.py
