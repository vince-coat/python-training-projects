# Shopping List (CLI Version 1)

This project is a simple command-line application that allows users to manage a shopping list.

## Description

In this first version, the shopping list is stored in memory only.  
Users can:

- Add items to the list
- Remove items from the list
- View the current shopping list

The list is not saved to disk in this version.  
The goal of this project is to practice:

- Working with Python lists
- User input handling
- Basic program structure

A more advanced version with data persistence will be developed later in the training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- No external dependencies

## How to Run

```bash
python3 shopping_list.py
